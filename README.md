# dotfiles

Collection of my dotfiles. 

## Setup

It is not advised to just copy someone elses dotfiles, rather look through them and choose which options work for you.
If you still want to clone my dotfiles read on:

First clone this repo in your home directory.

Then run setup.sh with first argument being either bash or zsh and second (optional) mac or linux.
This ensures that only dotfiles for shell you use are setup and dotfiles for apps only applicable for your OS.
